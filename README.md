# Random-Walk-Simulation-Using-HTCondor
## Project Overview
This project employs a Monte Carlo simulation to model the random walk of particles in a 2D space. The simulation, written in C, tracks the movement of particles until they reach a detector placed at a specific x-coordinate. The results are stored in a text file and visualized using Python, providing a histogram of the final y-coordinates where the particles hit the detector.
